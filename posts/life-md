I remember clearly, when I received my first offer during the Winter of 2024. It was a cold, harsh winter in Erie, and I remember clearly the voice that called me: "Congratulations, we would want to extend our offer to you". I clearly thinking: Wow, I finally got a job, and working full-time. But I could never understand why certain things never work out for me. Maybe I spoke about something too soon, or maybe I just have bad lucks. Either way, they rescinded the offer only 1 day because on that day, I was sick and could not respond to the email.

All the information was filled, and I had done all of my documentations. Literally. Ever thing was ready and I cannot wait to start work.

Then, they rescinded the offer and said that because on that one day, they wanted to see if the schedule make sense for me. Just one day. They rescinded the offer immediately because I was not able to respond to my email that day.
