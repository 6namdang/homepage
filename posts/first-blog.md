Game theory plays a significant contributions to economics, specifically applied micro-economics, which studies how human interact with each other via "playing". 

While this post will not specifically go deep into the history or definition of game theory, it will provides you with a different perspective of life and how to be look at the world in such a view that will allow you to understand why life is unfair.

## Definitions:
Game theory is a study of how rational people make decisions under uncertainty. For example, we can use the prison dilemma to explain rationality of people.

Prison dilemma: If both cooperate → each gets 3. If both defect → each gets 1. If one defects while other cooperates → defector gets 0, cooperator gets 5. Rationally, people would choose to defect, because rationally, if the other person defect and I corporate, I carried the other person's year time as well, so 3 < 5. But if we are speaking in terms of game theory, assuming both people are logically, choosing to both corporate would be more beneficials, because it would both lands 2 people at a sum of 2, which is less than 6 if both choose to defects.

As you can tell, the world is not rational at all, and full of ignorant, stupid people who only cares about playing zero-sum games. That does not mean that you can never wins, in fact, you should take this opportunity and use it to your self by doing the following things:

### Zero-sum game
Zero sum game is described as followed: If a person win, and another person lose, then it is a zero sum game. Suppose I gain +6 points, but at a cost where the other person lose -7, then the sum of (6 + -7) = -1, which is negative (negative sum).

I am not saying that we can ever avoid this kind of game, but you should avoid playing this zero-sum game as much as possible. We should only play, plan or investing our energy/resources to play positive-sum game ONLY. DO NOT GET INVOLVED IN A ZERO SUM game. Take this and applied anywhere in your life. If you are thinking about getting a job, or being in an organization, or going to this school, think about how your talents/skills can benefits them in a way, that they would be happy to pay money for. This is a good game, and both sides can benefits from this!

### Retaliation:

Retaliating is the most important part of Game Theory. If you're constantly being used/abused/taken advantage of, then you must retaliate. If you don't retaliate, you are playing a negative sum game. Do not ever do this. 

However, I must warn you that you should retaliate in a manner where it is not too extreme. Life is not 0 and 1, so it is hard to determine how much you should retaliate. You should examine carefully to understand what action shall you take, and how much you should retaliate.
